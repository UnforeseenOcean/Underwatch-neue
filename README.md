# Underwatch - Brand new start
Reconstruction of my parody game which perished with my hard disk

Yes, shit happens all the time. The game I was working on died along with my hard disk, thus making me unable to progress any further.

I needed to rewrite entire goddamned game all over again. :rage:

It was quite an **ASS**tonishing moment to observe. (lesson learned: a) never go cheap on the hard disk which you won't be backing up frequently and b) **avoid picking Seagate**)

Anyway we are back to square one, any updates on the project will be posted to this repository.
