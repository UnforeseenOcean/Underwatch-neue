You know what they say; Shit goes bad when you're sad!

Bush did 9/11

9/11 was an inside job

Give 'em what they want, I don't care

War is not a game, kids

Brain.exe has stopped working

Too bad!

YOU DIED

Did you know: I was a Vaporware for 10 years?

lol loser

Does anybody really care tho

You got a GLAMD STALL

Wirconi to thi Gala lol

Game crashed! Cause: Sued by Snowstorm Entertainment

In case you didn't know - War is bad and you shouldn't be fucking with it

If you fear someone could take your toy and misuse it, don't make it in the first place

Guess what - You suck

The best way to win the game is not to play it

I'm writing this in my free time, why don't you spend your wasted time on this

Try the game 100+ times, sometimes it will crash your computer
