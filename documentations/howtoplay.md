# How to play
You point at an enemy with your mouse, then use your left mouse button to shoot. Click right mouse button to use special attacks like nukes and cheapstakes.

You use WASD or arrow keys to move your character.

Try to stay focused on shooting stuff because it's very easy to get confused.

Blank areas are shown as black pixels on the map, enter here and you will get free game over.

Enemies are the ones that have different colored names on the top of the character, such as red or blue.

You shoot them until they drop dead. Quite easy.

You can use cheapstakes such as nuke (aids you at killing yourself too, and using this results in drastic change in game mode where all objectives change to running away as far as you can, with timer) and grenades (which also kills you if you don't run away fast enough) by cycling the selection using scroll wheel or R and T to select the one you want to use then pressing right mouse button.

Be careful, you cannot use enemy weapon and trying to use it by pressing E will result in immediate suicide. (Not really, it just shoots slowly and in random direction including on yourself)

Press tilde key or any key right below ESC key to use cheats. You will not be penalized for cheating, especially when using it to make the game even harder.

There are lots of things to do in the game itself, but not all of them will yield a good score.

For example, shooting bystanders will decrease your score by a factor of 4 while killing animals or ramming into protesters will result in an instant game over. For more information, try looking at hardrules.md for ruleset used in the game to see which action yields most score and which do not.

Failing to obey the rules in the game will result in either termination of the game session or a mark that shows how asshole you are.
