# Settings

## Controls
Press random keys until something happens. The first level you will start in is a tutorial level anyway.

Or go to Control config screen. That works too.

### Supported resolutions:
LOOK AT THE SETTINGS SCREEN, OKAY?

## Graphics
Try Ultra setting if you don't know shit about graphics stuff.

If you fuck it up, computer will tell you that you are fucking mental by crashing the game.

I'm unsure what TXAA x16 will do on a game which:
- obviously isn't 3D
- is mind-numbingly pixelated
- clearly isn't trying to simulate real-world at all (because if it did, the suicide rate would go through the roof)

So well, it's up to you. Go crazy with settings, I don't care.

## Sound setting
Here you can set how fast you want to lose your hearing. 

Move the slider to right to lose your hearing faster and do the opposite to lose your hearing slower.

You know, you can enable and disable stuff here and there but it won't do a thing because it still sucks monkey fuck.

Here are things you can change:
- Main music volume
- Sound effects
- Explosions
- Loudness
- Sad music volume
- Quaffs
- Terminal 7
- Air horns
- Buzzers
- Nuclear meltdown warning siren

Buuuuuut it still doesn't change the fact that you're playing a shit game and the developer certainly didn't give a flying fuck about your or his safety.

## Game over
So, you've got your first ever game over screen. Congrats! But you get nothing, because your life is miserable and I want to kill myself right now.
