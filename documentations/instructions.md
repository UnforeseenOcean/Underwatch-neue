### Supported resolutions:
LOOK AT THE SETTINGS SCREEN, OKAY?

## Graphics
Try Ultra setting if you don't know shit about graphics stuff.

If you fuck it up, computer will tell you that you are fucking mental by crashing the game.

I'm unsure what TXAA x16 will do on a game which:
- obviously isn't 3D
- mind-numbingly pixelated
- isn't trying to simulate real-world at all (because if it did, the suicide rate would go through the roof)

So well, it's up to you.
